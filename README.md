# HypoSyncNet
HypoSyncNet is a deep learning model that integrates reductionist and systems approaches to explore the relationship between hypothalamic neuron types and their electrical activity. By combining electrophysiological data with network dynamics, the model aims to simulate various hypothalamic functions.
