# HypoSyncNet
**HypoSyncNet** is a deep learning model designed to explore the relationship between different hypothalamic neuron types and their electrical activity. By integrating electrophysiological data with network dynamics, HypoSyncNet simulates the hypothalamus's role in regulating various physiological functions. The project combines reductionist and systems approaches to advance a deeper understanding of hypothalamic neural mechanisms.

Currently, HypoSyncNet is in the conceptual stage, and many aspects of the project may evolve. Extensive research and data gathering are required to determine the specific research direction moving forward.

The project is scheduled to start on December 1, 2024. Stay tuned!
